The diverse transcriptomes of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) contribute to their resistance to cell death, including ferroptosis, making it challenging to precisely characterize their sensitivity to death induction in brain-hypoxic environments. In this study, we employ an integrative approach that includes RNA sequencing of GSCs derived from five tumors under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and ex vivo treatment with the ferroptosis inducer RSL3. This approach aims to uncover a unified model of cellular heterogeneity in GSCs' stress responses. Through these analyses, we seek to unravel the complex interplay between cell death mechanisms, particularly ferroptosis, and glioblastoma pathophysiology. By elucidating the transcriptomic landscape that governs ferroptosis sensitivity, we aim to facilitate the development of potent therapeutic strategies targeting GSCs, advancing the prospects for effective glioblastoma treatment.

There is also a heatmap. User can choose many genes on heatmap. Heatmap is a morpheus-app software that is implemented in this project.
